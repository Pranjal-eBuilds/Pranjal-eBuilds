### 🌱 Who I Am

- 🧠 A 15 y/o builder exploring how ideas turn into real things  
- 🛠️ I create open-source projects — some digital, some physical, all fueled by curiosity  
- 🤖 I use tools like AI to help me move faster, but I take the time to understand how things work  
- 🧪 I believe in learning by doing, failing forward, and solving real-world problems — not just building for show

---

### 📁 What You’ll Find Here

- 🔓 Open-source projects with honest documentation  
- 📝 Reflections on what I understand, what I don’t, and what I’m learning  
- 🧰 Real effort: no fake flexing, no shortcuts — just progress  
- 📈 A growing archive of projects that reflect how I think, work, and learn

---

### 🔍 What I Know (Right Now)

- ❌ I don’t fully know how to code — yet  
- ✅ But I *do* know how to think clearly, ask better questions, and chase solutions  
- ⚙️ I explore, prototype, and learn by building, not waiting  
- 🤝 I treat AI as a collaborator, not a crutch — and I always credit where credit’s due

---

### 🎯 My Focus Right Now

- Turning real-world problems into open-source experiments  
- Learning HTML, Python, and logic — not just copying code, but *understanding* it  
- Becoming someone who builds useful, meaningful things that help people  
- Developing the mindset & portfolio of a future creator, researcher, and leader

### 🛠️ Projects I'm Building

Right now, I'm deep in the build phase.

I'm working on a few open-source projects that mix:
- 🧠 Real-world problem solving
- 🛠️ Physical + digital builds
- 🤖 AI as a creative tool (not a shortcut)

They’re still private or unfinished — because I’m focusing on **building them right**, not just pushing code to look active.

🚧 Everything will be public soon. For now: I’m in “heads-down, hands-on” mode.

> 🧪 *Learning by doing. Documenting as I go. Launching soon.*

### 📂 My Project Space

Here’s where all my current and upcoming projects live:  
👉 [github.com/Pranjal-eBuilds?tab=repositories](https://github.com/Pranjal-eBuilds?tab=repositories)

Some may look messy, half-done, or even broken — that’s on purpose.  
This is where I explore, build, test, and learn in public.
